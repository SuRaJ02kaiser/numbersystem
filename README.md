The index.js file includes a code which is used to find even and odd numbers from a given array .
The aap.js file includes a code which is used to find the prime numbers from a given array.

## ANSWERS
The answer for the index.js file is (Even = 4,16,28,8,14,6,2,12,30) & (Odd = 19,23,13,31,29,35,11,17,5,9,27).
Thne answer for the app.js file is  primeArray = [19,23,13,31,29,2,11,17,5].

## EXPECTED OUTCOME
The expected outcome of the first index.js file is that it will find the even and odd number and sort them out accordingly from an given array.
The expected  outcome of the second app.js file is that it will find the prime numbers from an given array and store all the prime numbers in a new array which is primeArray.
